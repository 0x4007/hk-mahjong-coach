# Architecture and implementation log

## 2026-08-02 — Repository initialization

- The repository was empty, so the existing `main` checkout is the canonical implementation lane.
- The runtime baseline is Node 24 LTS and pnpm 11.
- TypeScript 6.0 is pinned because the current `typescript-eslint` peer range excludes TypeScript 7.
- `better-sqlite3` is selected for stable synchronous transactions and mature Node 24 support.
- Workspace packages follow the dependency direction in `spec.md`; the root TypeScript path map is
  for development and tests, while package production exports point to built ESM artifacts.
- The server binds to `127.0.0.1`; the browser and API share one production origin.
- Compact tile codes are explicit, case-sensitive project display aliases; semantic IDs remain
  authoritative because MPS notation is not universal across mahjong variants.
- The canonical hash format is `sha256:<lowercase hex>`. Ruleset hashes cover validated,
  bonus-resolved, deeply frozen data and include `scoringEvaluatorVersion`.
- `rulesets/ruleset.schema.json` is generated from the runtime Zod schema by
  `pnpm rulesets:generate`; the generator materializes complete alternate profiles and applies the
  repository's formatting rules.

## 2026-08-02 — Versioned Hong Kong rules assumptions

- Seat bonus mapping is East/South/West/North → Plum/Orchid/Chrysanthemum/Bamboo and
  Spring/Summer/Autumn/Winter.
- The Hong Kong mahjong reading for 筒 is stored as Jyutping `tung4`.
- Four Concealed Pungs requires four concealed pungs, no declared kong, and self-draw.
- Nine Gates uses the strict pure nine-sided predecessor and permits no declared meld or kong.
- Thirteen Orphans does not require a thirteen-sided wait.
- Jade/Ruby/Pearl Dragon require three matching-suit pungs or kongs, the matching Dragon pung or
  kong, and a matching-suit pair; chows do not qualify.
- Heavenly Hand permits initial bonus replacements but no opening kong.
- Earthly Hand means a non-dealer win on East's first discard after initial replacements and before
  any kong or other call.
- Limit aggregation caps once while listing all matched limit features and suppresses lower-value
  composition rules.
- In `hk_modern_13f_v1`, unlisted former limit patterns are explicitly stored as 10 faan; only the
  four patterns named as 13/limit in `spec.md` use the 13-faan cap. There is no runtime inheritance.
